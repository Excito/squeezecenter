------

This directory contains library modules from CPAN which have been modified for SqueezeCenter.

We've made every effort to send patches to the upstream authors, but either
the changes are SqueezeCenter specific, or we simply haven't heard back from
the author, reside in a separate directory than the pristine top level CPAN/ dir.

If a patch has been accepted by the author, then the module should be moved
back to the top level CPAN directory.

In an ideal world, CPAN/ can be blown away, and the OSes packages can be used.
