As the upstream source included non-free stuff, they have been removed, 
these includes the CODE2000 fonts and the upstream firmware.

As the source package had to repackaged as well, aditionally the CPAN
and Bin directory has been removed, as they only takes space.

the get-orig-source will refetch the source, and makes the modifications.
