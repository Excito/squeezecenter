<p>
The Logitech Media Server can display artwork associated with each album.
This "cover art" is typically a copy of the CD/album's cover.
</p>
<p>
Artwork is displayed in several places within the Squeezebox software.
The details of the display vary depending on the skin currently being
used. The "Default", "Fishbone," and "Moser" skins have browse by cover art 
functions, clicking on a picture of the CD/album will select the album for
playing or processing. The "Default" and "Fishbone" skins also display the cover art
in the status display as the songs are played.
</P>

<h4>What is Artwork, how does the Squeezebox software use it?</h4>
<p>
Artwork is cover art from CD albums. It is displayed both to beautify 
the Squeezebox interface, and in the "Browse by album" section to
specify which albums are selected for playing or processing.
</p>

<h4>How do I get cover art?</h4>
<p>
Many site that sell CDs include
cover art in their catalog. With most browsers, you can right click
on the image and select "Save image as..."
</P>
<p>
Several third party developers have written utilities
to automatically retreive cover art based on the internal tags 
of your MP3, Ogg, Flac, or other files. See 
<a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/dev_third_party.html">http://www.slimdevices.com/dev_third_party.html</a> 
for more information.
</p>
<h4>Graphic file requirements</h4>
<p>The Squeezebox will display any graphic file that your browser can support. 
Nearly all browsers support .GIF and .JPG files, so most SlimDevices
customers use one of these file formats.</p>
<h4>Image sizes</h4>
<p>
The image files should be modest in size, as they are sized to fit
on the HTML browser window. There is no reason to have images
larger than 300x300 pixels, they won't be displayed with that size,
and it simply takes up space and bandwidth.
</P>

<h4>Technical details</h4>
<p>For each place in the skin that references a large cover art image,
the Squeezebox software performs the following search:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search in the current music directory for (in order): <br>
<ol><li>cover.jpg, cover.gif, <li>folder.jpg, folder.gif, <li>album.jpg, album.gif, <li>thumb.jpg, thumb.gif, <li>albumartsmall.jpg, albumartsmall.gif</ul>
</ol>
<p>
The Logitech Media Server will use the first image file located in this search.</p>

<p>
Logitech Media Server looks in the same path as the song, thus you would be looking for the
same artfile in this case.  However there is an option in Server Settings,
Advanced, Formatting for setting filenames for Artwork, Artwork Thumbnail, and
for setting a central location for artwork files. You can enter a specific filename 
if you use something not found in the list (eg, artwork.jpg).  You may also create 
filenames based on song variables.  If your first character is %, the server then parses
 the rest of the string as an InfoFormat, the same as title format is created.
</p>

<p>
As an example, you could create a single directory of songs and name all your
artwork as artist-album.jpg.  For this, enter a setting of</p> 
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;%ARTIST-ALBUM.jpg</pre> 
<p>for Artwork or Artwork Thumbnail in the server settings section.  The extension can be specified for any Logitech Media Server supported format, .jpg is
assumed if no extension is given.

</td></tr></table>
<p>Elements can be separated by anything (or nothing). The separators are only used
if the data elements are present.
</p>

<p>
The above list is included for completeness, it is unlikely that anyone would actually
want to have differing artwork files for songs of different bitrates, but the
ability is in the Logitech Media Server.
</P>

<p>
Artwork internal to the  ID3 tags within a song takes precedence, followed by any specified filename in the server
settings.  If an Artwork Folder setting is used (in Server Settings, Additional, Interface) then that folder is searched first
for any file matching those given for Artwork.
</p>

<p>
Browse by artwork and status BOTH scale the same image
file found for Thumb.  By default, the browse by artwork contrains to 100x100,
while the status constrains to 100 leaving aspect ratio intact.
